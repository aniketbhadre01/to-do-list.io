# to-do-list.io
create a to-do app to understand the basics of ReactJS. We will be working with class based components in this application and use the React-Bootstrap module to style the components. This to-do list can add new tasks we can also delete the tasks by clicking on them. The logic is handled by a click event handler whenever the user clicks on a task it gets deleted from the list.
